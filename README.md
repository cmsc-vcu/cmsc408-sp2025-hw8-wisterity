# cmsc408 hw8

This repository contains my work for CMSC 408, where I was tasked with analyzing data from the World Development Indicator (WDI) database. The goal of this assignment is to explore global development statistics and provide actionable insights using data analysis tools.

## Tools Used

- Github  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Quarto  
- VS Code  

## Project Process

- Clone the repository  
- Familiarize myself with the World Development Indicator (WDI) database  
- Use Python and Pandas to manipulate and analyze large datasets  
- Create interim tables to handle and process data efficiently  
- Perform detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on WDI data  
- Develop queries to extract relevant insights on global development indicators  
- Prepare the final report in Quarto, integrating results and visualizations  
- Generate and submit the HTML report to Canvas  
- Push the GitHub repository to Gradescope for autograding  

## Analysis Focus

In this assignment, Iâ€™ve focused on exploring key global development indicators like:

- Economic growth (GDP, inflation, trade)  
- Social progress (education, health, poverty)  
- Comparative analysis of countries across different years  

## Deliverables

- **GitHub Repository**: Contains the code for data manipulation, analysis, and visualizations.  
- **HTML Report**: Generated from Quarto, documenting the analysis process and results, with tables, charts, and insights drawn from the WDI database.

## Viewing

- Clone the repository  
- Run Python scripts for data analysis using Jupyter Notebook  
- Render the report with Quarto using `quarto render report.qmd`  
- Open the `report.html` file for the final analysis
